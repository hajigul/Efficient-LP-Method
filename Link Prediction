function [proposed_method_scores] = proposed_method(A,beta_val)

% proposed_method - Compute similarity score matrix
% A - is the adjacency matrix of the network
% beta_val - beta is damping parameter value
% after receiving these requirments, the proposed method calculated as hole similarity matrix and provide final accuracy 
% output proposed_method_scores returns similarity score between all pairs. The value is computed using all nodes.
